# Coding Test Overview

## React Native Recruitment Exercise

### Brief: Bills list view

### User Story: As a user, I want to see a list of my deferit bills in one place. This includes:

- A thumbnail of the bill image I uploaded so I know what bill it is. If I click on this thumbnail, I want to see the full image so that I can check it out properly.
- the amount of my bill
- the date of my bill
- the status of my bill (processing, scheduled, unable to pay, paid)
- an additional information pop-up next to fields I may not immediately understand (e.g. status) to give me some more information about this field (e.g:
- Processing: This bill is currently in processing, it can take approx. 1-2 hours depending on the time of day.
- Scheduled: This bill is scheduled to be paid and will be paid on the due date, you're in good hands!, etc.)
- Load only 10 (or some pre-defined number) bills at the time
- An infinite scroll to load next batch of bills if there are any
- We expect to have a reactive (clickable) solution with some dummy data (use some of the mock servers available online: e.g. http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

- Ideally, we would like to assess technical and styling/designing skills at the same time. Whilst there are no specific styling/design requirements, we would like to see what ideas/design decisions can be made for this task.

- Additionally, we would like to know how long it took to complete the solution.
